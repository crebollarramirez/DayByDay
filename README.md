# Day by Day Documenation 

## About this Project
I have always struggled with keeping a good schedule. To manage, I used a written planner but later found it inconvenent because I would lose it.
I later resorted to using Apple's calander app for a while but I later stopped because of how much I manually needed to add events. I later realized
that I wanted to find a way to make it easier to organize big plans that I wanted to complete. I was thinking of an app where it organized almost every aspect of my life which includes, meals, exercise, homework assignments, and long term goals. Of couse, I wanted it to be A.I powered to make it easier to make plans and have a little assistent help you accomplish your goals.
