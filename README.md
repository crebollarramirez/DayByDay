# Day by Day Documenation

## About this Project

I have always struggled with keeping a good schedule. To manage, I used a written planner but later found it inconvenent because I would lose it.
I later resorted to using Apple's calander app for a while but I later stopped because of how much I manually needed to add events. I later realized
that I wanted to find a way to make it easier to organize big plans that I wanted to complete. I was thinking of an app where it organized almost every aspect of my life which includes, meals, exercise, homework assignments, and long term goals. Of couse, I wanted it to be A.I powered to make it easier to make plans and have a little assistent help you accomplish your goals.

## Developer Notes

The app features an AI-powered scheduling assistant, which uses OpenAI's API for natural language processing. You can talk to the agent to create tasks, which will be written to the database. The agent can also read from the database to suggest a better schedule for the week, adapting to your goals and tasks.
